Overview
This research investigates low-dimensional linear discrete dynamical systems under constrained affine observations. It establishes a general mechanism where arithmetic restrictions and affine measurement design force a structural collapse of specific dynamical features.



The study focuses on second-order linear recurrences defined by x

 +bx 
n−1

 where a,b∈Z.

Key Scientific Contributions
This work identifies three coupled consequences induced by affine observation under arithmetic constraints:

Mode Collapse: Oscillatory components of the system become unobservable.


Dimensional Reduction: Admissible trajectories are confined to specific invariant lattices.


Arithmetic Rigidity: Observed dynamics are reduced to simple translations on discrete sets, exhibiting modular locking.



The central insight is that spectral cancellation is not a free design choice but a structural necessity compatible with integrality and invariance.


Mathematical Context
The system considers matrices with a dominant real eigenvalue λ>1 and a secondary real eigenvalue μ where μ<0 or ∣μ∣[cite 
s
​	
 tart]≤1. While classical linear filtering can eliminate modes via projection , this paper proves that affine observation forces this collapse as an unavoidable consequence of arithmetic consistency.
